# PinterestClone
# The Pinterest Clone is a responsive web application that mimics the core functionality of Pinterest, allowing users to browse visual content. This project was developed using the following technologies:
React: The primary library for building the user interface, allowing for component-based architecture and state management.
Material-UI (MUI): A library of React components that follows Google's Material Design guidelines, enhancing the aesthetic and usability of the application.
CSS: Used for custom styling, creating a visually appealing layout and ensuring responsiveness across various devices.
Axios: For making API requests to fetch images, ensuring that the app can load external data dynamically.
Infinite Scroll: Implemented to provide a seamless browsing experience, allowing users to load more images as they scroll down the page without manual pagination.
