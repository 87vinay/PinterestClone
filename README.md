# PinterestClone
This project is a Pinterest-inspired web app built using ReactJS, Unsplash API, and Material UI. It allows users to browse and save images from various categories in a masonry grid layout. Users can click on images to save them, with the saved images displayed on a dedicated Saved page, which persists through local storage. The project also includes infinite scrolling on the homepage, a responsive design, and the ability to delete images from the saved collection. The app features category-based image filtering and a clean, user-friendly interface.
